<p>As a Senior Lead in Project Management, I bring a wealth of experience and a passion for driving successful projects. Over the years, I have honed my skills in coordinating cross-functional teams, managing complex timelines, and delivering results that exceed expectations. My role involves not only overseeing project execution but also fostering a collaborative environment where innovation and efficiency thrive. Working closely with top collaborators like Gwen St. Julian, Sammy Munsch, and Miki Lieu, I have led numerous initiatives that have significantly contributed to our organization's growth and success. 
    <p>Outside of work, I am deeply committed to continuous learning and professional development. I believe that staying updated with the latest industry trends and best practices is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. Whether it's through attending workshops, participating in webinars, or engaging in peer discussions, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and share insights with my team. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about project management methodologies, and spending quality time with family and friends. I have two chihuhua's that I love to play with, named Tinkerbell and Tigerlily</p>
